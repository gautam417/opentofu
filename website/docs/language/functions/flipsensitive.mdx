# `flipsensitive` Function

`flipsensitive` takes any value and returns a copy of it with its sensitivity toggled. If the input value is sensitive, the function returns a non-sensitive version of the value. If the input value is not sensitive, the function returns a sensitive version of the value.

This function can be useful in scenarios where you need to temporarily change the sensitivity of a value for specific operations or outputs.

## Examples

```hcl
variable "secret" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}

locals {
  exposed_secret = flipsensitive(var.secret)
  hidden_value   = flipsensitive("public information")
}

output "exposed_secret" {
  value = local.exposed_secret
  # This will now show the value in plan/apply output
}

output "hidden_value" {
  value = local.hidden_value
  # This will be hidden in plan/apply output
}
```

## Usage Notes

- Use `flipsensitive` with caution, especially when exposing sensitive values. Ensure you understand the implications of changing a value's sensitivity.
- The function only changes the sensitivity marking of the value; it does not alter the underlying data.
- `flipsensitive` can be useful in situations where you need to selectively expose or hide values, but it should be used sparingly and thoughtfully in production configurations.

Remember that exposing sensitive values can have security implications. Always review your use of `flipsensitive` to ensure it aligns with your security requirements and best practices.
